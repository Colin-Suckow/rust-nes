# rust-nes wasm port
A toy Nintendo Entertainment System written in rust. This is my first non trivial rust project, so don't expect any idiomatic or otherwise exceptional rust.

This is an experimental webassembly port. This should really be its own repo, but I don't consider this to be a real project, so I'm just leaving it here in this branch.

### Supported Games
Only supports basic, mapper 0, 16k games right now, so this emulator doesn't run much.
- Donkey Kong
- Balloon Fight
